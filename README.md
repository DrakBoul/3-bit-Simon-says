# 3-Bit Simon Says
## Introduction
3-Bit Simon Says is a simple game implemented using an arduino and basic starter kit parts, such as resistors, buttons, LEDs, and the arduino itself. The goal of the project is to enhance the skills of people new to arduino, while making the process enjoyable by building a simple yet satisfying game.
## Parts and Data Sheets
__Note: The following parts and data sheets were the ones used specifically for the creators implementation.__
* ELEGOO UNO R3 Board (

## Getting Setup
We will start by cloning the 3-Bit Simon Says repository.

Navigate to the directory you want to clone the repository in, then past the following command:

```
git clone git@github.com:DrakBoul/3-bit-Simon-says.git
```

After cloning the repository into your desired working directory you, open the Arduino IDE, open the main.ino file, then upload the code onto your Arduino.

 You can use this link to download the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) if you have not done so already.

 Now after successfully uploading main.ino onto your Arduino you can start assembling the hardware component of this project. You may use the following picture below as a guide for assembling the hardware component.
